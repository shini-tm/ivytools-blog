# Filtering and pagination

The website only ever reads data from the supabase database. Each collection page has two calls:

- the initial fetch of the data
- the updated data when the database has been updated

At some point it would be nice to give each user their own unique login to track whose using (and potentially abusing the database). There is a file called `supabaseClient.js`:

```.
├── ivytools
│   ├── ...
│   ├── pages
│   ├── public
│   └──  utils
│       └── supabaseClient.js
...
```

## Supabase login

```import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
const supabase = createClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
export default supabase
```
