# Adding to supabase database

Unfortunately, the script we are using to update everything is in python. Why not switch to javascript? I'm just not a fan with the single-threaded nature of javascript (and dart, the other language supported by supabase). But fortunately the workaround's are not that horrible.

Some basic functions are available (inserting, reading, updating, deleting records is do-able) but other things like creating tables (necessary for every individual collection) are not. Instead we have to use a python library called [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) which allows us to connect directly to the postgres database on supabase:

```py
import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import Error
from psycopg2 import sql

try:
    # Connect to an existing database
    connection = psycopg2.connect(user=POSTGRES_USER,
                                  password=POSTGRES_PASS,
                                  host=POSTGRES_HOST,
                                  port="5432",
                                  database=POSTGERS_DATABASE)

    # Create a cursor to perform database operations
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    ...
```

You can test to see if you're connecting properly with the following code. But also don't forget to close the connection!

```py
     ...
     # Print PostgreSQL details
     print("PostgreSQL server information")
     print(connection.get_dsn_parameters(), "\n")
     # Executing a SQL query
     cursor.execute("SELECT version();")
     # Fetch result
     record = cursor.fetchone()
     print("You are connected to - ", record, "\n")

except (Exception, Error) as error:
    print("Error while connecting to PostgreSQL", error)
finally:
    if (connection):
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()
        print("PostgreSQL connection is closed")
```

## Creating new table for connection

Once you've connected with `cursor = connection.cursor()` we can do something like this:

```py
    # SQL query to create a new table
    create_table_query = '''CREATE TABLE {table}
          (token_id                 int PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
          last_fetched_timestamp    varchar(26) NOT NULL,
          listing_price             REAL,
          listing_timestamp         varchar(26),
          highest_offer_price       REAL,
          highest_offer_timestamp   varchar(26),
          last_sale_price           REAL,
          last_sale_timestamp       varchar(26),
          rarity_score              REAL,
          rank                      int,
          traits                    TEXT,
          owner                     varchar(42) NOT NULL,
          CONSTRAINT CHK_listing_pair_nulltest CHECK ((listing_price IS NULL and listing_timestamp IS NULL) OR (listing_price IS NOT NULL and listing_timestamp IS NOT NULL)),
          CONSTRAINT CHK_highest_offer_pair_nulltest CHECK ((highest_offer_price IS NULL and highest_offer_timestamp IS NULL) OR (highest_offer_price IS NOT NULL and highest_offer_timestamp IS NOT NULL)),
          CONSTRAINT CHK_last_sale_pair_nulltest CHECK ((last_sale_price IS NULL and last_sale_timestamp IS NULL) OR (last_sale_price IS NOT NULL and last_sale_timestamp IS NOT NULL)),
          CONSTRAINT CHK_timestamp_length_26 CHECK ((length(last_fetched_timestamp) = 26))
          ); '''
    table_name = 'Sales_data__neo-tokey9o'
    # Execute a command: this creates a new table
    cursor.execute(sql.SQL(create_table_query)
                    .format(table=sql.Identifier(table_name)))
    connection.commit()
    print("Table created successfully in PostgreSQL ")
```

I couldn't be bothered to all the constraints, just because i want to get a end sellable product as quickly made as possible. But we can add further constraints. Like forcing the timestamps to be a certain format, (similar to the schema typescript files), etc.

## USE THE sql.Identifier BOILERPLATE

I think there is some security risk associated with just injecting dynamic names any other way. neo-tokey9o is just an example name.

## On the bright side

We only really need it for creating the table which is literally the only use-case. It's just a useful heads up for anyone having to read up on this.
